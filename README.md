# The Yalla Extension For Google Chrome #

**[Yalla](https://www.yallahq.com)** is a collaboration and project management app built at [Lemonade Stand.](https://www.lemonadestand.org) This Chrome extension lets you add priorities to your board and others' from anywhere on the web.

### Simple Setup ###

After [downloading the extension from the Chrome store,](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yalla/jhlpghijadgjojbpepmkegbbefgnioeo) you just need to give the extension your Yalla API key. It'll store that and use it to make all of its AJAX calls to Yalla.

### Easy to Use ###

Essentially a mini web form, the Yalla extension pops up a small window to create your priority whenever you click its icon in the top-right corner of your browser. Like in Yalla, you can set the priority's title (required), description, subtasks, due date and assigned user and client (all optional). Click the "Send" button and the extension will bundle that information into an AJAX POST request and ship it to Yalla.
